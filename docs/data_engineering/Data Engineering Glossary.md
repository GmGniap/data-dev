|Data artifacts|Data Dictionary, Data Model, Data Flows, Data Stewardship, Dimensional Model, Data Sharing Agreement|
|Data dictionary|A data dictionary contains information (metadata) about the elements, names, attributes, and definition related to the data in a database|
|Data flow diagram|Represent a flow of data through a subcomponent of, or the entirety of, a process or a system.|
|Data tuple|Related data elements such as a record in a database|
|DDL|Data Definition Language, such as creating database objects|
|Dimension table|table that is descriptive key information, which contains nontransactional data used in OLAP system|
|Dimensional modeling|Using star schema or snowflake schemas, create a relationship among dimension and fact tables|
