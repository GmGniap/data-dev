Isolation, Durability designed on the foundations of relational algebra CRUD Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete for transactional data management systems Data Architecture It is a discipline of rules, policies, and models that define what data to collect, how to use it, where to store it, and how to integrate distributed and heterogeneous systems separated in silos Data artifacts Data Dictionary, Data Model, Data Flows, Data Stewardship, Dimensional Model, Data Sharing Agreement Data dictionary A data dictionary contains information (metadata) about the elements, names, attributes, and definition related to the data in a database Data flow diagram Represent a flow of data through a subcomponent of, or the entirety of, a process or a system. Data tuple Related data elements such as a record in a database DDL Data Definition Language, such as creating database objects Dimension table table that is descriptive key information, which contains nontransactional data used in OLAP system Dimensional modeling Using star schema or snowflake schemas, create a relationship among dimension and fact tables Logical models Represent business concepts within a relationship diagram Meta database At the highest of levels, it is a database model for metadata management. Metadata Data about data. Information related to the contents, format, location, size, etc OLAP Online Analytical Processing used for understanding the patterns OLTP Online Transaction Processing built on sound relational database systems Reporting Accessing and querying the data to find insights, trends, analysis, and other information Row-based storage The entire ROW of data is stored as one chunk. The first column of a given row will be next to the last column of the previous row Silo physical or logical separation of data without any relationship with other data sets Single Version of Truth Some business terms and rules have multiple meanings when there is a data dictionary. With a standard dictionary, business vocabulary can have a single version, hence data can have a single version, no matter who looks at it. Stewardship Accountability and responsibility for data assets and processes that ensure effective control and access. Tribal knowledge Undocumented information or knowledge that is known to people, who are experienced doing a particular task with any written documentation"},{"location":"data_engineering/dbt/intro_dbt/","title":"Intro to Data Build Tool (dbt)","text":"<p>dbt \u1006\u102d\u102f\u1010\u102c\u1000 Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) \u101e\u102d\u102f\u1037\u1019\u101f\u102f\u1010\u103a Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) data pipeline \u1011\u1032\u1019\u103e\u102c Transform \u1006\u102d\u102f\u1010\u1032\u1037 \u1021\u1015\u102d\u102f\u1004\u103a\u1038\u1000\u102d\u102f \u1021\u1011\u1030\u1038\u1015\u103c\u102f\u101c\u102f\u1015\u103a\u1006\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a\u1015\u1031\u1038\u1010\u1032\u1037 open-source tool \u1010\u1005\u103a\u1001\u102f \u1016\u103c\u1005\u103a\u1015\u102b\u1010\u101a\u103a\u104b </p>"},{"location":"data_viz/Tableau/Tableau%20Data%20Extract%20%28TDE%29/","title":"Tableau Data Extract (TDE)","text":""},{"location":"data_viz/Tableau/Tableau%20Data%20Extract%20%28TDE%29/#tde","title":"TDE \u1006\u102d\u102f\u1010\u102c \u1018\u102c\u101c\u1032?","text":"<p>Tableau Viz \u1010\u1005\u103a\u1001\u102f\u1000\u102d\u102f \u1021\u101c\u103b\u103e\u1004\u103a\u1021\u1019\u103c\u1014\u103a render \u1015\u103c\u101e\u1016\u102d\u102f\u1037\u1021\u1010\u103d\u1000\u103a Disk \u1011\u1032\u1019\u103e\u102c compressed snapshot \u1021\u1014\u1031\u1014\u1032\u1037 \u1012\u1031\u1010\u102c \u101e\u102d\u1019\u103a\u1038\u1006\u100a\u103a\u1038\u1011\u102c\u1038\u1015\u103c\u102e\u1038 Memory \u1011\u1032\u1000\u102d\u102f loaded \u1015\u103c\u102f\u101c\u102f\u1015\u103a\u1011\u102c\u1038\u1010\u102c\u1000\u102d\u102f Tableau Data Extract \u101c\u102d\u102f\u1037 \u1001\u1031\u102b\u103a\u1015\u102b\u1010\u101a\u103a\u104b </p>"},{"location":"data_viz/Tableau/Tableau%20Data%20Extract%20%28TDE%29/#_1","title":"\u1021\u101e\u102f\u1036\u1038\u1001\u103b\u1014\u1031\u101b\u102c\u1019\u103b\u102c\u1038","text":"<ol> <li>Performance</li> <li>Reduced load</li> <li>Portability</li> <li>Pre-aggregations</li> <li>Materialization of calculated field</li> <li>Publishing to Tableau Public and Tableau Online</li> </ol>"},{"location":"data_viz/Tableau/Tableau%20Data%20Extract%20%28TDE%29/#-tde-architectuse","title":"\u1010\u100a\u103a\u1006\u1031\u102c\u1000\u103a\u1015\u102f\u1036 - TDE Architectuse","text":"<ul> <li>Tableau Official Documentation - Understanding Data Extracts</li> </ul> <p>TDE design \u1014\u1032\u1037 \u1015\u1010\u103a\u101e\u1010\u103a\u1015\u103c\u102e\u1038 \u1005\u102d\u1010\u103a\u101d\u1004\u103a\u1005\u102c\u1038\u1005\u101b\u102c \u1042 \u1001\u102f\u1000\u1010\u1031\u102c\u1037  1.
